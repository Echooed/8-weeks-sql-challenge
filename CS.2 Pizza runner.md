**Problem Statement: Pizza Runner Data Optimization**

**Background:**
Danny, the owner of Pizza Runner, is keen on leveraging data science to enhance the efficiency and performance of his pizza delivery business. He has shared a dataset containing information about runners, customer orders, and pizza details within the pizza_runner database schema. As a data scientist, your task is to analyze the data, clean it, and perform various calculations to optimize Pizza Runner's operations.

**Objective:**
The primary goal is to assist Danny in improving Pizza Runner's operations by addressing key areas such as pizza metrics, runner and customer experience, ingredient optimization, and pricing and ratings. Your solutions should provide actionable insights to enhance the overall performance and customer satisfaction of Pizza Runner.

**Data Overview:**

- The dataset includes information on runners' registration dates, customer orders with pizza details, runner assignments, and pizza recipes with toppings.
- Tables: runners, customer_orders, runner_orders, pizza_names, pizza_recipes, and pizza_toppings.

**Areas of Focus:**

1. **Pizza Metrics:**
    - Analyze the total number of orders for each pizza type.
    - Identify the top 3 pizzas by order count.
2. **Runner and Customer Experience:**
    - Calculate the average delivery time for successfully completed orders.
    - Identify the top 3 runners with the highest average distance traveled.

    - Mark all orders with a null pickup_time as pending.
    - Delete all canceled orders.

**Deliverables:**
You are required to provide SQL queries for each of the tasks outlined in the problem statement. The queries should be well-structured, efficient, and capable of producing actionable insights to optimize Pizza Runner's operations.
