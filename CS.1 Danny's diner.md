## Business Problem Brief
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.
Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

_**Danny has shared with us 3 key datasets for this case study:**_

- `sales`
- `menu`
- `members`

You can inspect the entity relationship diagram and example data below.

## Bonus question

```mysql
-- 1. Create a basic data table for Danny's employees

SELECT
  sales.customer_id,
  sales.order_date,
  menu.product_name,
  menu.price,
  CASE
    WHEN sales.order_date < members.join_date THEN "N"
    WHEN sales.order_date >= members.join_date THEN "Y"
    ELSE "N"
  END AS member
FROM
  sales
  JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
  LEFT JOIN members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
ORDER BY
  customer_id;
```



Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.

```mysql
-- 2. Rank All The Things

WITH joined_table AS (
    SELECT sales.customer_id, 
           sales.order_date, 
           menu.product_name, 
           menu.price,
           CASE 
               WHEN sales.order_date < members.join_date THEN "N"
               WHEN sales.order_date >= members.join_date THEN "Y"			
               ELSE "N"
           END AS member
    FROM sales 
    JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
    LEFT JOIN members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id 
    ORDER BY customer_id
)
SELECT customer_id, 
       order_date, 
       product_name, 
       price, 
       member,
       CASE WHEN member = "N" THEN "null"
          ELSE RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY member, customer_id ORDER BY order_date, price DESC)
       END AS ranking
FROM joined_table;
```
